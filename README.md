**A tiny authenticator that lives in the menu bar and in a customisable keyboard shortcut**

MicroAuth is customisable multi-factor authentication client for macOS that sits in the menu bar, easily accessible and out of your way, and _lets you paste a current authentication code into any application with a single, configurable, keyboard shortcut_.

## Installation

**Just download the installer [here](https://github.com/d-falck/MicroAuth/releases/download/v1.8/MicroAuth_1.8_Installer.dmg).**

Note that the first time you launch MicroAuth **you'll have to right-click the app** (once it's in your Applications folder) **and click 'Open'** (and then Open again) to bypass Apple's security (it would cost me Â£99 to get apps signed by Apple to avoid this problem).

## Setup

Your organisation will provide you with a secret key which you copy into the app. For Office 365 users (including members of Oxford University), you can get this by going to `https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info -> Add method -> Authenticator app -> Add -> I want to use a different authenticator app -> Next -> Can't scan image`.

## Usage

When you use your configured keyboard shortcut in any application, MicroAuth will get a current authentication code and paste it into whatever text field your cursor is in. Alternatively, you can manually view and copy the current code from the MicroAuth icon in the menu bar, where you can also access preferences.

## Requirements

Requires macOS version 10.15 (Catalina) or later.
